    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "    - It is easily interpretable \n",
    "- **Weaknesses:** \n",
    "    - It can only separate binary problems\n",
    "    - The relationship between features and outocme have to be linear for logistic regression to work\n",
    "    - It doesn't do well when highly correlated features are uses so in a sense it needs the features to be vetted for correlation before they can be used as inputs to a logistic regressor\n",
    "    - Requires that the user has indentified all the important independent features\n",
    "    - It is vulnerable to overfitting\n",
    "- **What makes this model a good candidate for the problem:**\n",
    "    - The outcome we have to predict is binary. So logistic regression would be effective in such cases. Also the features come in different ranges. Like working hours vary in double digits while features like working class vary between 0 or 1. In such a scenario, if one does not normalize the data, logistic regression will perform better given the differences in scale and outliers in each feature get prounouced less because the model evalautes logit based probability functions which confines the value of each sample between 0 and 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Decision Tree:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-world application**\n",
    "    - Decision trees are used in a wide array of business, medical and content suggestion algorithms. One example is medical diagnosis of diseases based on given symptoms\n",
    "- **Strengths:**\n",
    "    - Yields very intuitive and easily interpretable model\n",
    "    - Can select the most important interactions fraom a large number of variables in the data\n",
    "    - It can be used to predict both quantitative and catagorical outputs  \n",
    "    - Can handle large sets of features and performs better if the relationship between outcome and features is complex and non linear\n",
    "    - It doesn't rely as much on clean data compared to other models as it is relatively more immune to outliers and missing data\n",
    "- **Weaknesses:** \n",
    "    - It tends to overfit\n",
    "    - Small changes in data can lead to different decision trees and hence it undermines interpretability\n",
    "    - The resulting trees are not very reproducible on future data\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **What makes this model a good candidate for the problem:**\n",
    "    - The outcome is categorical and the input variables are a mixture of categorical and numirical inputs. Also the relationship of target variable is not quite clear to each feature \n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Random Forest Classifier:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-world application**\n",
    "    - Random Forest classifiers are widely used in real world applications. One easy example is it's use in Ecommerce for predicting whether a customer will like a product or not.\n",
    "- **Strengths:**\n",
    "    - It can be used in both regression and classification problems\n",
    "    - It is relatively computationally less expensive and is fast\n",
    "    - It is also easy to implement\n",
    "    - Like decision trees it is a great tool to highlight feature importance\n",
    "    - It has relatively fewer hyper parameters to tune\n",
    "    - Contrary to decision trees, random forest estimator is much more immune to overfitting\n",
    "- **Weaknesses:** \n",
    "    - The most prominent limitation is that a large number of trees might make this model too slow for real time applications. As the number of trees grows, the predictions become more reliable but at the same time the computational cost and hence the computation time of predictions goes higher \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **What makes this model a good candidate for the problem:**\n",
    "    - There's a large number of features, some are categorical and some numerical. Relationship of each feature to outcome is not quite clear. Given that our application is not real time one, prediction speed should not be an issue and on top of that we would want to avoid over fitting which makes this model one of the favorites for this application. \n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",

    "- The testing score of logistic regression is almost equal to that of random forests\n",

    "The random forest classifier will make multiple simple decision tress out of randomly selected subsets of features. Each of these trees wil be trained over those randomly selected features. \n",
    "Once all these separate 'trees in the 'forest' are built, the final predictions are made by letting each of these trees 'vote' on whether a given individual is making more than $50,000 or not. This is done by letting each 'tree' in the 'forest' predict the outcome and then the final outcome will be decided with whichever state (does the individual make more than 50K or not) has the most votes. This way it is ensured that model is very resistant to overfitting the training data and predictions are more stable.\n",

    "### Implementation: Model Tuning\n",
    "Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list, the following implementation may take some time to run!"

    "- The accuracy and F-score are 0.8607 and 0.7349 on the optimized model respectively. The scores are slightly better than the unoptimized model. The accuracy and F-score on the unoptimized model were 0.8433 and 0.6848 respectively. I am not surprised at little improvement after optimization because random forest classifiers tend to gernerally do pretty good with default values of the classifier. \n",
    "- The above being said, it is worth noting that though the change in accuracy from 0.8433 to 0.8607 may not be significant but the change in F-score from 0.6848 to 0.7349 is significant. It shows that even though the unoptimized model is relatively as accurate as the optimized model (though slightly less accurate) it's precision is much worse than optimized model. In other words, when the optimized model predicts that an individual is making more than 50K it is much more likely to be true compared to when the unoptimized model makes the same prediction. \n",
    "- The naive predictor yielded accuracy score of 0.2478 and F-score: of 0.2917. The results from the optimized model are much better than this. "

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "The five features that I believe to be most predictive in their ranked order are as follows:\n",

    "- 2) **marital-status** takes the second because usually individuals tend to think of marriage when they are relatively satisfied with their income. So married individuals will be more likely to be making more than 50K\n",
    "- 3) **hours-per-week** takes 3rd spot, as the more an individual works the more likely they are to be making more than 50K. Though per hour rate may vary based on profession\n",
    "- 4) **capital-gain** takes the 4th spot since it's a net income on top of one's regular income so it boosts chances of making above 50K. It is not taking any of the first 3 spots because most of the capital gains reported in the dataset are not significant enough to clearly indicate that a given indvidual makes more than 50K \n",
    "- 5) **education-num** takes the 5th spot because the higher the education level the more likely and individual's income is higher based on 'better' qualifications. Though it may not always be true for example one needs the same amount of years to do bachelor's degree in IT vs Arts, but the average income of individuals in both these fields is very different.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "- The accuracy score dropped by a little bit but F-score dropped more significantly after using only 5 most useful features to train the model. It seems precision of the model suffered more so than accuracy. Precision is important in our application so the drop in F-score is not necessarily a good trade off.\n",
    "- Now whether I will consider the reduced number of features or not if training time was a factor. I would but after trying a few other things such as reducing the number of estimators in my random forest classifier first. Moreover, looking at testing score as the number of training samples is increased shows that there is very little change in testing score when 10% of training data is used vs when 100% of the training data is used. This indicates that instead of using all my training set for training my model I could use a much smaller subset of it to reduce training time. That said, if all else failed to lower my training time to the specification, only then I will consider using only these 5 features. "
